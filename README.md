# simpleJavaGame
This project was made in 2023 as a part of a school progamming project.
I think it has a lot of problems and the code is very messy and stuff, i could do a better work but i don't think it's worth to put work on it.

# Compilation

Use `javac jogo/*.java entidades/*.java mapa/*.java server/*.java` and them run `java jogo/Jogo` and it will run.

# Multiplayer

The multiplayer ip is configured to the local host, and the default sever port is 1212, it's very messy and buggy but if you want to give it a shot it will work.
